This Python project implements a model for forecasting daily births based on historical data. It leverages powerful libraries like pandas and Facebook Prophet to predict future birth trends.

Data Preparation

Obtain historical daily birth data (e.g., from government agencies, healthcare providers).
Ensure the data is in a suitable format (e.g., CSV, Excel).
The data should have columns representing date (in a format suitable for pandas) and daily birth count.
Place the data file in the data directory (create it if it doesn't exist).

Output

The script will generate a visualization of the historical birth data and the forecasted trend.
The forecast results (predicted daily births for a specified future period) will be saved to a CSV file named daily_births_forecast.csv (modify the file name if desired).
